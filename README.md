# What is this application?
This application is a simple android application focused on speedrunning. The application contains a simple database of times for several different games and on
each game's page, the times recorded by the app for each game are displayed, along with ranking.

The application also contains a simple timer, which allows users to also split their times and will show previous splits inside of the application.
